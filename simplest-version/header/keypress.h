    Turn off echoing in terminal. 
    #define ECHO -> set ECHO bit = 0 in c_lflag
    - When input some character from keyboard, it won't show on terminal, 
        but after press Enter, it will show on terminal
    - We can use this function to make input password from user is invisable

    Turn off canonical mode
    #define ICANON 0000002
    - When in canonical mode, user enters entire line before processing.
    - When turn canonical mode off, this means we will finally be reading input byte-by-byte, instead of line-by-line.
    - That mean, if in canonical mode, program only get user input when user press enter, 
        but when turn off it, program can get any character from user input without press enter

    Disable Ctrl_C and Ctrl_Z -> make them like normal input
    Turn off ctrl_C and ctrl_Z and ctrl_D signals
    #define ISIG 0000001 -> Enable signals.
    - When set ISIG is 0 in c_lflag, then ctrl_C and ctrl_Z and ctrl_D (not use) don't cause to exit progam immediately

    Disable Ctrl_S and Ctrl_Q
    Turn to XOFF flow control for Ctrl_S and Ctrl_Q by ~IXON
    - Set to c_iflag (view on docs/termion.md) 
    - IXO on is XON/XOFF flow control `Ctrl+Q/Ctrl+S`
    - ~IXON that `Ctrl+Q/Ctrl+S` no longer works, enter as normal character

    Diable Ctrl_V
    - Set to c_lflag
    - IEXTEN enable implementation-defined input processing like ctrl_V, ctrl_O 
    - ~IEXTEN giving the program more control over the input, ctrlV/ctrl_O no longer works, enter as normal character
    
    Fix Ctrl_M <and Ctrl_J>
    - Ctrl_M is equal 10, Ctrl_J and Enter are both also equal 10 
    - Target to set Ctrl_M = 13
    - Set to c_iflag
    - ICRNL -> Map CR to NL on input. CR is carriage return and NL is new line
    - Turn off ICRNL that make Ctrl_M = 13 and Enter is also equal 13, but Ctrl_J = 10

    Turn off all output processing
    - Set to c_oflag with ~OPOST
    - A newline '\n' = 10 translated to '\r\n'
    - So, if want to make a new line, take '\r\n'

    Turn off Breaking input like ctrl_c by set to c_iflag = ~BRKINT (I know, we have done it, but I think we need to make sure that program follow what we want)
    Turn off parity check by set to c_iflag = ~INPCK
    Preserve all 8 bits of the character by set to c_iflag = ~ISTRIP

    Set to control mode c_cflag |= CS8 -> set size of data is 8 bit

    Currently, read() will wait indefinitely for input from the keyboard before it returns. 
        What if we want to do something like animate something on the screen while waiting for user input? 
        We can set a timeout, so that read() returns if it doesnâ€™t get any input for a certain amount of time.
    - Set VMIN and VTIME to c_cc[type] to control special event
    - VMIN = 0 -> No need to enter any characters first to start reading
    - VTIME = 1 -> 1 milisecond to exit read() when no characters are entered

    Set atext(func) to call disableRawMode when exit program
